You can work in this repository, just making some static pages.

For now I'd like to see the following:

Header/NavBar containing the following links: 
Home, Current Projects, Past Projects, Blog

Footer containing the following links:
About, Contact, CV

A background that can be used across the site

A Dynamic carousel on the homepage with images and links

A Div styling to add things like blog posts.

That's all for now, but there might be more later.
